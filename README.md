# This codebase consists of codes for the following:
## [1] Fortran and Python codes for generating hamiltonian matrix for many body models (including long range hopping, interactions, et.c.)
## [2] Graph Traversal Algorithms using mathematica and Python package - NetworkX.

## [3] Block Tri-Diagonalisation of Sparse, Banded Matrix.

## [4] Implementation of Fock space Recursive Greens functions (FRGF) and its integration with Bandwidth reduction Algorithms
Recursive procedure involves obtaining a Block-Tridiagonal Representation, followed by (i) Forward (ii) Backward and (iii) off-Diagonal Recursive relations
